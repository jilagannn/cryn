# C.R.Y.N

## Commands-Run-You-Nap

C.R.Y.N. is a set of bash scripts I came up with to deal with recurring directory setups for projects or assignments.

## Lineup

### choncc.sh

A script written to create Express.js applications, installing the required build dependencies and dev dependencies, and creating the API project structure. This script also configures jest.config.js for jest testing and the scripts for package.json.

### styling.sh

A separate shell script file that contains several escape codes for text formatting and styling.
